# Workout Log

---

[Live app]( https://workout-log-bc47f.web.app/)

Workout log app created for tracking my weightlifting. Many workout apps are slow, loaded with ads, pricey, or tailored toward a specific routine, so I wanted to create a simple and customizable web app. This is my first app to use any kind of back end (Firebase) which can handle users and save data, so feel free to log in with your Google account and try logging your routine while you're at the gym.

Keep in mind that I have access to any data that you add. If you'd like me to delete your data or send you a copy of your data, feel free to contact me at tkeyes@gmail.com. 

### Features

- Log in with a Google account to track workouts.
- Add and edit custom exercises.
- Create a new workout and add custom exercises, along with sets and reps for each.
- Copy a previous workout which can then be modified.
- Delete workouts, exercises, sets and reps.

### Features to add

- Save all changes automatically (user currently needs to click 'Save Workout' after making changes).
- Calendar for choosing a past workout (currently all workouts are in one list from newest to oldest).
- Optional units (lbs/kg).
- Options for different types (non-weightlifting) of workouts.
- Warning for users to confirm that they want to delete the workout.
- Improve design (especially for larger screens, as app was built for mobile screens).

### I learned about

- Using Firebase user authentication to allow users to login with Google.
- Using Firebase to store read and write user data.
- Using Tailwind for CSS.
